PowerAPI is a middleware toolkit for building software-defined power meters.
Software-defined power meters are configurable software libraries that can estimate the power consumption of software in real-time.
PowerAPI supports the acquisition of raw metrics from a wide diversity of sensors (*eg.*, physical meters, processor interfaces, hardware counters, OS counters) and the delivery of power consumptions via different channels (including file system, network, web, graphical).
As a middleware toolkit, PowerAPI offers the capability of assembling power meters *«à la carte»* to accommodate user requirements.

# PowerAPI

PowerAPI is an open-source project developed by the [Spirals research group](https://team.inria.fr/spirals) (University of Lille and Inria) and fully managed with [setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/).

The documentation is available [here](https://powerapi.readthedocs.io).

## Use Cases
PowerAPI is used in a variety of projects to address key challenges of GreenIT:
* [GenPack](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01403486) provides a Docker Swarm strategy to minimize the energy footprint of  Docker containers deployed in a cluster
* [BitWatts](http://bitwatts.powerapi.org) provides process-level power estimation of applications running in virtual machines
* [Web Energy Archive](http://webenergyarchive.com) ranks popular websites based on the energy footpring they imposes to browsers
* [Greenspector](http://greenspector.com) optimises the power consumption of software by identifying potential energy leaks in the source code.

We all stand on the shoulders of giants and get by with a little help from our friends. PowerAPI is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.7 under [PSF license](https://docs.python.org/3/license.html)) and built on top of:
* [pyzmq](https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq) (version 17.1 under [3-Clause BSD license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)), for socket communication.
* [pymongo](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver) (version 3.7.2 under [Apache 2 license](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver/blob/master/LICENSE)), for using a python API for mongoDB.
