# Reports

PowerAPI toolkit is modular, which means any sensor can be plugged to any monitoring
tool as long as the needed information is provided.
We fixed the way of encoding the information. Those encoding are called `Reports`.  

A report type specify the `json` fields that has to be provided to pass information of
a certain kind. All reports types have a common basis:


- `timestamp`: at the [format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) "YYYY-MM-DDThh\:mm\:ss\.sss". The timestamp indicates when the data was collected, not when it was processed.  

- `target`: The target refers to the entity being measured. For example, if a report contains data related to a specific program, domain, or other entity, the target identifies that subject. In this context, it corresponds to the cgroup name.

- `sensor`: it's a name field that is used to identify the reports produced by or computed thanks to a sensor.  

Therefore, a report shall match the following description: 

```json
{  
  "timestamp":$timestamp,
  "target":$target,
  "sensor":$sensor,
  $report_specific_fields
}
```

A valid JSON-Schema to can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/powerapi-ng/powerapi-ng.github.io/refs/heads/master/docs/reference/reports/basis-reports.schema.json).

In the following sections we specify the `$report_specific_fields` for each type of report.

## HWPC Reports

A `HWPC Report` is used to report performance counters and RAPL.
Its specific fields are the following:

- `groups`: a list of subreport that can be of three kind, `rapl`, `core` and
  `msr`.

  Each group is represented in the same way:

```json
  {
    $type: {
      $core_number : {
        $socket_number : {
          Each counter name and their measured value for the type/core_number/socket_number considered triplet
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

Below you can find an example of `HWPC Report`:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-01-13T09:51:22.630",
  "sensor": "sensor_test",
  "target": "influxdb",
  "groups": {
    "core": {
      "0": {
        "0": {
          "CPU_CLK_THREAD_UNHALTED:THREAD_P": 75510,
          "CPU_CLK_THREAD_UNHALTED:REF_P": 2271,
          "time_enabled": 167403,
          "time_running": 167403,
          "LLC_MISSES": 1077,
          "INSTRUCTIONS_RETIRED": 31693
        },
        "1": {

          "CPU_CLK_THREAD_UNHALTED:REF_P": 1318,
          "time_enabled": 99324,
          "time_running": 99324,
          "LLC_MISSES": 750,
          "INSTRUCTIONS_RETIRED": 15011
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
{
  "timestamp" : "2023-01-13T09:51:22.630",
  "sensor" : "sensor_test",
  "target" : "all",
  "groups" : {
    "rapl" : {
      "0" : {
        "1" : {
			      "RAPL_ENERGY_PKG" : 5709496320,
			      "time_enabled" : 1006717449,
			      "time_running" : 1006717449
          }
      }
    },
    "msr" : {
      "0" : {
        "0" : {
          "MPERF" : 29646849,
	        "APERF" : 12319312,
	        "TSC" : 2122153094,
	        "time_enabled" : 1006580601,
	        "time_running" : 1006580601
        },
        "1" : {
          "MPERF" : 20587012,
          "APERF" : 19838920,
          "TSC" : 2122185970,
	        "time_enabled" : 1006560540,
	        "time_running" : 1006560540
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

## Power Reports

A `Power Report` is used to transfer information about power consumption estimations.
Its specific fields are the following:

- `power`: a power value in Watts.

Below you find an exemple of `Power Report`:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-01-14T12:37:37.168817",
  "sensor": "formula_group",
  "target": "all",
  "power": 42
}
```

<!-- ## Procfs Report

A `ProcfsReport` is used to transfer information about CPU usage of
process.
Its specific fields are the following:

- `global_cpu_usage` : The used percentage of the CPU.
- `usage`: A list of the monitored processes with their percentage of CPU usage.

Below you find an exemple of `ProcfsReport`:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-01-14T12:37:37.168817",
  "sensor": "formula_group",
  "target": ["firefox_cgroup", "emacs_cgroup", "zsh_cgroup", "mongo_cgroup"],
  "usage": {
    "firefox_cgroup": 8.36,
    "emacs_cgroup": 5.52,
    "zsh_cgroup": 0.01,
    "mongo_cgroup": 0.64
  },
  "global_cpu_usage": 27.610000000000014
}
